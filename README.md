# air-traffic-control-simulator

#### This repository contains the source code for our air traffic control simulator. It takes in as input trajectory data of flights over a fixed time series and outputs a series of air traffic commands for each individual aircraft in order to ensure safety while minimising time delay and fuel consumption.
